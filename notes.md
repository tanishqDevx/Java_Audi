# Java Notes

## _this_ keyword :

- Used to reference the current object in java.

**Shadowing** : When the input parameter shares the same name as that of the instance variable, the shadow of the input parameter falls on the instance variable and the instance variable remains unchanged, this concept is known as shadowing.

- Due to shadowing, _JVM_ is unable to distinguish between variable and instance variable.
- To get rid of Shadowing, we use _this_.

### Example :

```java
class account{
    String name = "Bharath";
    void newName(String name){
        this.name = name; //this refers to reference variable rather than parameter.
    }
}
```

## Types of Constructors:

2 types of constructors :

- Default Constructor

```java
public class BankAccount {
    int balance;
    BankAccount(){
        balance = 5000;
    }
}
//BankAccount Ram = new BankAccount();
```

- Parametric Constructor

```java
public class BankAccount {
    int balance;
    BankAccount(int bal){
        balance = bal;
    }
}
//BankAccount Ram = new BankAccount(1000);
```

Can Object have multiple states at the time of its creation? If yes, how is it achieved?

> Yes, an object can have multiple states while creation. It can be created by _Default Constructor_ or _Parametric Constructor_. We can also have multiple constructors. See the example [here](./BankAccount.java)

## Constructor:

- A constructor is a **code block** that is used to initialize a object.
- It has the same name as the class in which it resides.
- It is syntactically same as a method. But it is **not** a method. Because we can not call a constructor again and again in a single lifetime of a object. We can call a method as many times as we want.
- Constructor is automatically invoked whenever an object of class is created. you cannot invoke a constructor.
- It is called an executed only once per object.
- Default Constructors are the ones which are created without parameters.

There are 2 types of constructors. They are

- Implicit Constructor
- Explicit Constructor

> The _Implicit Constructor_ only works when there is **no** constructor declared.
>
> If we have one or more constructors defined, JVM will not invoke a _Implicit Constructor_. We have to declare a _Explicit Constructor_.

If there are two constructors with same number of parameters, JVM chooses a constructor only when

---

When we create a instance variable, it gets created for every object. But incase of methods they don't get copied like instance variables, they belong to the class. Similarly, if we want a variable to be same for all objects (be wrt to the class) then we make it a static variable.

## Static Variable

A variable which belongs to the class is called as a static variable.

- **Perm gen** is a area which stores the _static variables_.

- **Heap** is where the objects are stored.

```Java
class Book{
    static int stock; // same for all objects.
    String bookName;
    double bookPrice;
    Book(String name,double price){
        stock++; // Keeps track of how many books are there.
        bookName = name;
        bookPrice = price;
    }
}
```

- We don't need to create a instance of the class ( _a.k.a object_ ) to access a Static Variable.

```java
System.out.println(Book.stock); // works.
Book book1 = new Book("name1",2000)
System.out.println(book1.stock); // works here too.
book1.stock = 20; // Will change the original stock.
```

- Static Variables are created when the class is loaded and they die when the class is unloaded.

- Static Variables are created because of **Memory Efficiency**.

#### What is a Static Method?

To invoke a static method, we don't have to create a object, but whereas the regular methods need to be invoked only after creating a object. But both the methods aren't copied for every method.

### Why is the _main_ method Static?

JVM invokes main without creating the filename-object. It directly invokes `filename.main()`. If we made it just `public void main()` instead of `public static void main()` then the JVM will not be able to invoke main directly. This is the reason for it being static.

**Deepa mam Answer:**

Whenever a method is declared as static, it can be directly invoked without creating an object. Static methods belong to class. So, as soon as the class is loaded into JVM, the static method is available to be invoked.

### Whenever you declare a method as static, instance variables cannot be used in this context. Why?

- Static variables can't use instance variables. They can, however, use local/static variables.

- This is also the reason for not being able to use non static methods in a static context.

- Memory for static members is allocated only once at class loading.

- Cannot use [**_this_**](#this-keyword-) or [**_super_**]()

> Can a reference variable be declared as Static? [Single ton designing pattern.]

## Initializers

> Read Initializers from the Internet.

- Run [This](./Bank.java) to see more about initializers.

`{ ... }` is called **Instance Initializer**, its called by JVM automatically before anything else, and if there are multiple then they are called in the order they are defined.

### Output :

```
Static Initializer Called something
Initializer 1 Called 1
Initializer 2 Called 2
2
```

#### Anything that is instance can use static but anything that is static cannot use instance.

### Why do we need Initializers?

- **Static Initializer :** In order to initialize static variables or to execute any piece of code when a class is loaded, we use static initializers.

- **Instance Initializer :** If we write a code and we need that to be executed when a instance is created, we use Instance Initializer.

- Initializers are executed before constructors.

### What is Constructor Chaining?

In a class, there can be several constructors present (overloaded constructors) and all these constructors should be invoked while creating a single object. Then we used the concept of constructor chaining.

We do this with `this(args);`

### Why do we need constructor chains?

Depending on the data available, different constructors are invoked, resulting in different states of the object. But, if all the objects need to come together and have the same state, then we need to chain these constructors.

## Order of execution

Lets see if [this](./Order.md) goes to 2 pages XD

## Inheritance

When one class (A) attains the state and behavior of another class (B), it is said to be following inheritance property. A is the child, derived, specialized. B is the parent, base, generalized.

- Instead of having repetitive code in the similar classes, we can save the common functionality in a common class.

- Changes made in the base class is affecting all the child classes.

### See Example [Here](./person.java)

- A parent class CAN'T access the state and behavior of child, but a Child CAN access all the state and behavior of the parent.

> Whenever a child class object is getting created, the base class object gets created prior to it.

- The objects are created like this :
  - when you say `deepa.name` it checks if `Teacher` has name, then if it doesn't then it checks `person` for the name.
  - When it finds the name it does not create a copy of instance variable for `Teacher`, **it creates instance variable `name` in the instance of the `person`**.

### Static variables are inherited to children.

## `super()` :

- `super()` is the reference to the parent constructor.
- `this()` is the reference to the current instance variable.
- It should **always** be in the first line of the constructor.

> Create a librarian and a principal. Each class should have its own state and behavior. Let the classes have only parameterized constructors. principle and librarian and teacher eat their lunch together after performing their duties.

### What is overriding?

When the child class / derived class requires the same functionality as the parent class but wants to change its implementation, then it wants to re define that method in its own class. This process is called as over riding.

There are several rules for over riding :

1. The name of the method should be same.
2. Parameter list ( no. of parameters, data type, and order of parameters ) should be same.
3. Return type should be same / should be the subclass of the return type of the overridden method. ( Law of Covariance )
4. Access modifiers should not be restricted.
5. Final Method cannot be over ridden.

The one in parent class is over ridden, the one in child class is over riding.

## `final` keyword :

It's basically like `const` of python. All final objects are also usually declared as static.

We can use this keyword with :

### Instance Variable

---

You can only assign the value in one of 2 places, they are :

1. While declaring it

```java
class Person{
    final String name = "Bharath";
}
```

2. In the constructor

```java
class Person{
    final String name;
    Person(){
        name = "Bharath";
    }
}
```

### Local Variable

---

We can assign it while declaring, or do this :

```java
final String name;
name = "Bharath"; //immediately in next line
```

### Reference Variable

---

We can not change the reference variable's value (Memory address), but we can use the reference variable to change what it's referring to.

```java
final Person p;
p = new Person();

p.name = "Bharath"; // works fine
```

### Methods

---

Overriding can not be done on methods that have been declared as final. We can not change the methods once they are declared as final.

- But we can inherit these methods.

### Others

- Initializers and constructors can not be final, because there can be more than one of constructors and initializers. And we can not say that they wont be changed.

- Whenever the class is declared as final, we can not inherit the class anymore. Inheritance will get disabled.

> ## Take a look at [these](./questions/10%20questions/) problems.

## Abstract

Whenever a method is declared as abstract, it doesn't have any body.

### Why is it necessary for the subclass to override abstract methods?

When we declare a method as abstract, we are enforcing that all the children have that method. Even if we don't give it a implementation/ a body, we know that children will have to have that method and they will implement the functionality by adding their own body.

- When all the children of a class override a certain method, we should delete the body of that method and declare it as abstract.
- When the parent wants to enforce a method, but don't know how the children will use that method, it can define that method as abstract.
- If we don't want people to create objects of a given class, we can make it abstract.
- We have to

Whenever a method is declared as abstract in a class, class should be declared as abstract too.

### Abstract classes are made because :

- all methods abstract
- implementing it because a method is abstract
- don't want to have objects.

### why is a class abstract when a method is abstract?

If we create a object from the class, if someone calls the abstract method, that method will not have a body because its abstract, so it will not know its implementation.

### Why methods and classes can't be both abstract and final?

Final stops inheritance, abstract demands inheritance.

> ## Take a look at [this](./Cars.java) and also [this.](./car_plan.md)

and

> ## Go through [these questions](./questions/10%20questions/)

- An abstract class can have a mixture of both concrete methods and abstract methods(No body).
- The JVM tries to protect a disaster, which is a method we invoked on an abstract class. If the method which is abstract, where will the JVM search for the body? So it does not allow to invoke methods on a abstract class.

## Packages

We define a class / file to be in a package by writing

```java
package Kmit;
class example {
    //code in example now belongs to package kmit
}
```

- To compile a class inside a package, we do `javac classname.java -d .` where `-d` stands for directory and `.` stands for current dir.

- When we run that command then we get a folder with name "kmit".

- All packages can access `public` things from anywhere.

- We run `classname.class` by running `java kmit.classname`

### Single ton design pattern

---

There is only one object in the whole system.

```
public class single {
    int i;
    public static single a;
    static int counter;
    private single(int i){
        this.i = i;
        counter++;
    }

    public static single create(int i){
        if (counter < 2){
            return a = new single(i);
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("no obj created.");
            return a;
        }
    }
    void display(){
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}
```

## Polymorphism

It is of 2 types :

- Runtime Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism
- Compile time Polymorphism / Static Polymorphism

## Inheritance

Inheritance

It is of 2 types :

- Single inheritance
- Multi level inheritance

#### Java only supports _single inheritance_.

## Interfaces

An Interface is a contract that specifies what methods a class should implement, without specifying how these methods should be implemented.

Interfaces provides a way to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in java, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.

**Coding Convention:** Define the name of interface as `IPlayer` or `IPerson`, etc... basically add `I` to the start of the name.

```java
interface IPlayer {
    void win();
    void lose();
    void play();
}

interface IPerson {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}

class chessPlayer implements IPlayer, IPerson {
    public void win() {...}
    public void lose() {...}
    public void play() {...}
    public void eat() {...}
    public void sleep() {...}
}
```

Basically same as **Abstract Class** but we can implement multiple Interfaces, so its possible to implement both IPlayer and IPerson.

### API

API - Application Programming _**Interface**_

An interface is a public contract between an Implementing platform and the user.

So they publish a interface with **`abstract methods`**. Also there is a **`.jar`** file which has implementation classes in binary format. Hence we can use their code with APIs using these 2 things.

There are 3rd party libraries which provide us with implementation classes. These libraries are the binary files.

**Abstraction :** Hiding away the implementation of the functionality and giving the users a way to use their methods through APIs.

- By default, all the methods in the Interface are **abstract** and **public**. We can change this and give a body to a method of interface by using a keyword `default`

```java
interface ITest{
    void tested(); // abstract and public by default
    default void testing() {
        System.out.println("This works fine."); // this can have body because we used keyword default.
    }
}
```

- All variables are static and **final** by **default**.

- Interface references can be used to point the objects that implements their associated interface.

### Interface can't implement another interface.

- We can have empty interfaces, they are called _**Marker Interfaces**_.

### Functional Interface :

- A functional interface is a interface with only single abstract method. They can have any number of static or default methods. These are used to create **lambda functions** in Java.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface kmit {
    void m();
}

class testFI {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        kmit i = ()->{
            //function
            System.out.println("Lambda function")
        }
        i.m(); // prints Lambda function
    }
}
```

See [this](./testFI.java) file.

## What do you mean by loose coupling of code?

Whenever you create an application, you create 'N' no. of classes, these classes can can have "is-a" relationship or "has-a" relationship or relationship with interfaces. The code should be written in such a way that any addition/deletion in a problem statement should not affect the code. Nothing should be re-written.

## exception handling

## See [this](./Exception%20notes2.txt) file.

## Java Exception Handling – Questions & Answers

### 1. What is the difference between Error, Throwable, and Exception?

- **Throwable** is the superclass for all errors and exceptions in Java.
- **Exception** represents conditions that a program should handle (e.g., file not found, invalid input).
- **Error** represents serious issues that a program should not try to handle (e.g., OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError).

Example:

```java
try {
    int a = 5 / 0; // Exception
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Handled Exception!");
}

// Error example
// throw new OutOfMemoryError("System memory full");
```

---

### 2. Give examples of Error and Exception.

- **Error examples:** OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, VirtualMachineError
- **Exception examples:** NullPointerException, IOException, ArithmeticException, FileNotFoundException

Example:

```java
// Error example
// throw new StackOverflowError("Stack overflow!");

// Exception example
String s = null;
System.out.println(s.length()); // Throws NullPointerException
```

---

### 3. Why use `try` and `catch`?

They help handle exceptions gracefully so the program doesn’t crash.
Instead of the program terminating abruptly, we can provide user-friendly messages or recovery logic.

Example:

```java
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("You can't divide by zero!");
}
```

---

### 4. Why does a programmer need to implement `try` and `catch`?

Because certain operations (like file I/O, network access, or invalid user input) can fail.
Handling these exceptions ensures the program behaves predictably even in unexpected situations.

Example:

```java
try {
    FileReader fr = new FileReader("file.txt");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("File not found!");
}
```

---

### 5. What will happen if he doesn’t do it?

If exceptions occur and are **not handled**, the program will terminate abruptly, showing an **exception stack trace**.

Example:

```java
int a = 10 / 0; // Without try-catch → program crashes
```

---

### 6. What is a bug in a program?

A **bug** is a logical or syntactical mistake in the program that leads to incorrect or unexpected behavior.

Example:

```java
// Bug: logic mistake
int marks = -10;
System.out.println("Percentage: " + marks + "%"); // Logically wrong value
```

---

### 7. Can a `try` have multiple `catch` blocks?

- **Yes**, one `try` can have **multiple `catch`** blocks to handle different types of exceptions separately.

### Can a `catch` have multiple `try` blocks?

- **No**, one `catch` block cannot directly have multiple `try` blocks, but multiple `try-catch` pairs can exist.

Example:

```java
try {
    int a = 5 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Division by zero");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Other exception");
}
```

---

### 8. Can I implement `try` and `catch` and still the program can stop due to an exception?

Yes.
If an exception occurs **outside** of the `try` block or is **not caught properly**, the program may still stop.
Example: catching the wrong type of exception.

```java
try {
    int a = 10 / 0;
} catch (NullPointerException e) {
    System.out.println("Wrong type caught!");
}
// Program still crashes
```

---

### 9. Can a `catch` have `try` and `catch`? Give an example.

Yes, **nested try-catch** is allowed.

Example:

```java
try {
    int a = 5 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    try {
        int b = Integer.parseInt("abc");
    } catch (NumberFormatException ex) {
        System.out.println("Nested catch block");
    }
}
```

---

### 10. What are the different types of exceptions?

1. **Checked Exceptions** – Checked at compile-time (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
2. **Unchecked Exceptions** – Occur at runtime (e.g., NullPointerException, ArithmeticException).
3. **Errors** – Serious problems that cannot be recovered (e.g., OutOfMemoryError).

Example:

```java
// Checked
try {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("test.txt");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("Handled Checked Exception");
}

// Unchecked
int num = 5 / 0; // ArithmeticException
```

---

### 11. Major difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?

| Feature             | Checked Exception         | Unchecked Exception                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Checked by compiler | Yes                       | No                                        |
| When occurs         | Compile-time              | Runtime                                   |
| Examples            | IOException, SQLException | NullPointerException, ArithmeticException |
| Must be handled     | Yes                       | No (optional)                             |

Example:

```java
// Checked
try {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    System.out.println("Handled Checked Exception");
}

// Unchecked
String str = null;
System.out.println(str.length()); // Throws NullPointerException
```

---

### 12. Difference between syntax error at compile time and checked exception?

- **Syntax error:** Mistake in code structure (e.g., missing semicolon), caught by the **compiler** immediately.
- **Checked exception:** A valid statement that might fail during execution (e.g., file not found), compiler forces handling.

Example:

```java
// Syntax Error (will not compile)
// System.out.println("Hello"

// Checked Exception (must be handled)
try {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("data.txt");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("File not found!");
}
```

---

### 13. Why do checked exceptions even exist?

They ensure programmers handle predictable problems (like missing files or invalid input) at compile-time, improving program reliability.

Example:

```java
try {
    FileReader fr = new FileReader("students.txt");
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    System.out.println("Please check if file exists!");
}
```

---

### 14. In the following code:

```java
catch (Exception e) {
    // ...
}
```

- **What is `e`?**
  → It is the **reference variable** that holds the thrown Exception object.

- **Who creates it?**
  → The **JVM** creates it when the exception occurs.

- **Where does it come from?**
  → It is created and thrown by the **JVM or the `throw` statement** in the program.

Example:

```java
try {
    int x = 10 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
